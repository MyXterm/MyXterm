# electron-mobx
Maybe this is the most lightweight starter for `electron` & `MobX`.

 As I said this is a lightweight starter,you may need to add another loader or plugins yourself such as `less-loader` to use `less` in your project or `sass-loader` to use `sass`,it's all up to you.I'm just trying to make it as simple as it could be.

### how to start development

Just cd to this directory and run `npm start`.

### hot to build 

Simple run `npm run build` as start.

### Roadmap
-[ ] Bug : Must hit `F5` in the devtools to see the code...
-[ ] add some code in `main process`,and maybe use `Mobx` in `main process` too.
-[ ] add menu management
